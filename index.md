Hi there, my name is Jonathan and I am a PhD Candidate at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab (<a href="//www.cltl.nl">CLTL</a>) is where my research is mainly carried out, advised by Prof. dr. Antske Fokkens and dr. Lisa Beinborn. My project falls under a larger consortium named <a href="https://interpretingdl.github.io/">InDeep: Interpreting Deep Learning Models for Text and Sound</a>. As a baseline, I am unsatisfied with NLP systems when I don't know what they really know and really can do; therefore, I investigate how language models can be interpreted, with a focus on <b>Argument Mining</b>. The project is a collaboration with <a href="https://moonlit.ai">Moonlit.ai</a>, a legal research platform based in Amsterdam (Deloitte Netherlands).

My background is in language studies (Spanish), intercultural communication, and linguistics (both theoretical and computational). Prior to the start of my PhD, I have been working as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.converz.co">Converz Analytics</a>, developing conversational AI technology. 

In my free time you can find me hunting Strava KOMs on my Bianchi (<i>none</i> so far) and sometimes in the virtual chess arena.

Feel free te get in touch!
