Hi there, my name is Jonathan and I am a PhD Candidate at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab is where my research is mainly carried out, advised by Prof. dr. Antske Fokkens and Prof. dr. Lisa Beinborn. My project falls under a larger consortium named <a href="https://projects.illc.uva.nl/indeep/"><b>InDeep: Interpreting Deep Learning Models for Text and Sound</b></a>. I investigate the biases that exist in language models and the biases in approaches that promise to explain them. <i>Non Ã¨ tutto oro quel che luccica</i>: All that glitters is not gold. Or is it?

My background is in language studies (Spanish), intercultural communication, and linguistics (both theoretical and computational). Prior to the start of my PhD, I have been working as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.converz.co">Converz Analytics</a>, developing conversational AI technology. 

In my free time you can find me hunting Strava KOMs on my Bianchi (<s>none</s><i>some</i> so far) and sometimes in the virtual chess arena.
Feel free to get in touch!
