Hi there, my name is Jonathan and I am a PhD Candidate at Vrije Universiteit Amsterdam. The Computational Linguistics and Text Mining Lab is where my research is mainly carried out, advised by Prof. dr. Antske Fokkens and Prof. dr. Lisa Beinborn. My project falls under a larger consortium named <a href="https://projects.illc.uva.nl/indeep/"><b>InDeep: Interpreting Deep Learning Models for Text and Sound</b></a>. I investigate how language models can be interpreted, with a focus on <b>Argument Mining</b>. The project is a collaboration with <a href="https://moonlit.ai">Moonlit.ai</a>, a legal research platform based in Amsterdam (Deloitte Netherlands).

My background is in language studies (Spanish), intercultural communication, and linguistics (both theoretical and computational). Prior to the start of my PhD, I have been working as a Data Scientist at <a href="https://www.converz.co">Converz Analytics</a>, developing conversational AI technology. 

In my free time you can find me hunting Strava KOMs on my Bianchi's (<i>none</i> so far) and sometimes in the virtual chess arena.
Feel free to get in touch!
